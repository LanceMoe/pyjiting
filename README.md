# Pyjiting

Pyjiting is a experimental Python-JIT compiler, which is the product of my undergraduate thesis. My goal is to implement a miniature general-purpose Python JIT compiler.

Inspired by [numpile](https://dev.stephendiehl.com/numpile/) and continue to work on this basis.

## Functions that have been implemented so far

1. Optimize type inference based on TypeHints
2. Function calls Python code also can be JIT compiled
3. Implement basic functions such as IF expressions
4. Implement recursion
